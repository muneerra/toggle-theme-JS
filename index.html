            Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.

            When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need a
            variable here,” and add it to your code.

            Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already used them unknowingly
            many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about
            understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.

            <h3>tl;dr</h3>
            You have a closure when a function accesses variables defined outside of it.

            For example, this code snippet contains a closure:
            <span class="codeBlock">
                let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica'];
                let query = 'A';
                let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));
            </span>
            Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. It uses the query variable. But the query
            variable is defined outside of that function. That’s a closure.
            You can stop reading here, if you want. The rest of this article approaches closures in a different way.
            Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the process of discovering closures — like
            the first programmers did in the 1960s.

            <h3>Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</h3>
            To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and functions. In this example, we
            declare the food variable inside the eat function:
            <span class="codeBlock">
                function eat() {
                let food = 'cheese';
                console.log(food + ' is good');
                }
                eat(); // Logs 'cheese is good'
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a function gives us the ultimate flexibility because we can run this function any number of times, at
            any time — and from anywhere in our program.

            In fact, we can even call our new function only once, if we wanted to:
            <span class="codeBlock">
                function doTheThing() {
                /* A snippet of code */
                }
                doTheThing();
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Step 2: Discovering Closures</h3>
            We have traced our way through two different ideas:

            Functions can access variables defined outside of them.
            Wrapping code in a function and calling it once doesn’t change the result.
            Now let’s see what happens if we combine them.

            We’ll take our code example from the first step:
            <span class="codeBlock">
                let food = 'cheese';
                function eat() {
                console.log(food + ' is good');
                }
                eat();
            </span>
        </p>
